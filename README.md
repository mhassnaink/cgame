## 🧭 Overview

**cgame** is a **header-only**, **CPU-based**, **cross-compiler C++ framework** designed to give developers direct, low-level control over rendering and GUI systems — without the weight of traditional engines or external dependencies.  

Developed over a focused two-week period for **Windows**, cgame defines its own rendering pipeline, event system, and drawing interface entirely in C++, while maintaining the clean, minimal syntax that developers expect from modern libraries.  

Unlike wrappers or API bindings, **cgame *is* the framework** — written from the ground up to compete with large-scale libraries like **Raylib**, **SDL**, and **SFML** in speed, simplicity, and structure, but with **zero dependencies** beyond the C++ Standard Library.

---

## ⚙️ Core Features

- 🧩 **Header-only design** — easy to include, compile, and extend.  
- ⚡ **Pure CPU-based rendering** — deterministic and consistent on all hardware.  
- 🪶 **Lightweight architecture** — minimal binary size, minimal overhead.  
- 🧠 **Fully self-contained** — no external DLLs, link libraries, or hidden dependencies.  
- 🪟 **Custom GUI system** — includes primitives like rectangles, rounded rectangles, and images.  
- ⌨️ **Complete input handling** — built-in keyboard and mouse APIs.  
- 🧰 **Cross-compiler support** — tested with **MinGW** and **MSVC (Visual Studio 2022)**.  
- 🌍 **Cross-platform roadmap** — future versions will add Linux and macOS support.

## 🧱 Design Philosophy

The vision behind **cgame** is to bring **clarity and full control** back into C++ graphical programming.  
Every function, event, and pixel in cgame is intentionally transparent — there are **no hidden abstractions**, **no opaque layers**, and **no unnecessary dependencies**.  

**cgame** was developed with three core principles:  

1. **Simplicity** — Code that is easy to read, modify, and extend.  
2. **Performance** — Predictable, real-time responsiveness using only CPU processing.  
3. **Transparency** — Every frame, event, and draw call is visible in source.  

The result is a library that feels closer to the metal — giving developers a deeper understanding of rendering, input, and GUI systems, while staying modern and elegant.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

At its core, **cgame** consists of three main modules:

### 1. Display
Handles window creation, resizing, DPI awareness, and basic graphics API initialization.

```cpp
cgame.init									();
CGameScreen screen = cgame.display.set_mode (int width, int height, int flags);
cgame.display.set_title 				    (const char* title);
cgame.display.set_icon				        (const char* iconFilePath);
cgame.display.set_icon_from_image			(const CGameImage *img);
````

**Flags:**

* `CGAME_RESIZABLE` – Allows window resizing.
* `CGAME_DPI_AWARE` – Enables DPI correction/scaling.
* `CGAME_OPENGL` – Uses OpenGL as the rendering backend.
* `CGAME_VULKAN` – Uses Vulkan (planned).
* `CGAME_D3D12` – Uses DirectX 12 (MSVC only).

---

### 2. Event System

Handles all user input events (keyboard, mouse, and window system).

```cpp
int event = cgame.event.get();

if (event == cgame.QUIT)         // Quit event
if (event == cgame.KEYDOWN)      // Key pressed
if (event == cgame.KEYUP)        // Key released
if (event == cgame.VIDEORESIZE)  // Window resized
```

---

### 3. Drawing API

Provides simple but efficient drawing routines.

```cpp
cgame.draw.rect			 	 (int x, int y, int w, int h, int border_width, int r, int g, int b);             // Outline rect
cgame.draw.fill_rect		 (x, y, w, h, r, g, b);                											  // Filled  rect
cgame.draw.rounded_rect		 (int x, int y, int w, int h, int radius, int border_width, int r, int g, int b); // Rounded outline
cgame.draw.rounded_fill_rect (x, y, w, h, radius, r, g, b);						  					    	  // Rounded fill
cgame.draw.circle		     (int x, int y, int radius, int border_width, int r, int g, int b);				  // Circle  outline
cgame.draw.fill_circle		 (int x, int y, int radius, int r, int g, int b);								  // Circle  fill
```

**Images:**

```cpp
CGameImage image = cgame.image.load ("icon.png");       // Loads   image
image = cgame.image.resize		    (&image, 200, 200); // Resizes image
image = cgame.image.rotate		    (&image, 30.0f);    // Rotates image
image = cgame.image.flip_vertical   (&image);		    // Flips   image vertically
image = cgame.image.flip_horizontal (&image);	        // Flips   image horizontally
cgame.image.draw				    (&image, 100, 100); // Draws   image
cgame.image.unload				    (&image);		    // Unloads image
```

---

### 4. Input System

Keyboard and mouse input are fully integrated.

```cpp
if (cgame.key.pressed       (cgame.K_a    )) // Key held
if (cgame.key.just_pressed  (cgame.K_SPACE)) // Key pressed once
if (cgame.key.just_released (cgame.K_d    )) // Key released

if (cgame.mouse.pressed       (CGameButtonLeft  ))
if (cgame.mouse.just_pressed  (CGameButtonRight ))
if (cgame.mouse.just_released (CGameButtonMiddle))
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Example

```cpp
#include <cgame/cgame.h>
int main() {
    cgame.init();
    CGameScreen screen = cgame.display.set_mode(800, 600, CGAME_RESIZABLE | CGAME_DPI_AWARE);
    // cgame.display.set_title("Hello from cgame!");

    while (true) {
        if (cgame.event.get() == cgame.QUIT) break;
        cgame.display.set_bgcolor (245, 245, 250);
        cgame.display.clear       ();
        cgame.draw.fill_rect      (250, 150, 300, 300, 255, 128, 64);
        cgame.display.flip        ();
    }

    cgame.quit();
}
```

## 🧩 Build Instructions

### 🪟 **MinGW**

Example `Makefile`:

```makefile
CXX      = g++
CXXFLAGS = -Iinclude
LDFLAGS  = -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lgdiplus -lmsimg32 -lws2_32 -municode

SRC      = src/main.cpp
TARGET   = main
 
all:
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(SRC) -o $(TARGET) $(LDFLAGS) 
clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET).exe

```

Build manually:

```bash
g++ -Iinclude src/main.cpp -o main.exe -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lgdiplus -lmsimg32 -lws2_32 -municode
```

---

### 🧱 **MSVC (Visual Studio 2022)**

Link the following libraries:

```
opengl32.lib
gdi32.lib
gdiplus.lib
msimg32.lib
ws2_32.lib
```

Then compile with `/std:c++17` or newer.

## 💭 Developer Motive

> “The goal was never to wrap an existing library — it was to *create one*.”

**cgame** was born from a desire to build a **true low-level C++ graphical framework** — something that could rival existing libraries in performance and design, but without external weight.

It’s designed to teach, to empower, and to run fast — giving developers a space where they can *see* what their code does, and *understand* how each frame is built.
